# PrayerApp
An attempt at a Daily Prayer app for the church In Wales

This is the proof-of-concept release.

It can:

1. Read different layouts to deal with the difference in layouts of Morning Prayer
2. It offers different Bible readings based on the day
3. It produces a simple scrolling interface for Morning Prayer. 

It contains:
1. The ability to be bi-lingual (while this feature is not avaialable in this release, the functionality is there under the hood)
2. The ability to cope with different prayer lay-outs, which will (in time) include Evening Prayer and so on. 

That said, it is a proof-of-concept, and as such only does a very limited number of things to show that it can, in fact, be done. 

Thanks,
