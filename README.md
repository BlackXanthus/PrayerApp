# PrayerApp
An attempt at a prayer app, initially aimed at the Church In Wales

This app is an attempt to bring the Church In Wales Daily Offices to a mobile device. 

It is currently available from the Android Play Store. 

It can:

Offer Morning and Evening prayer in both English and Welsh
Includes inline bible readings from the Church In Wales lectionary

Version 1.2.1 is mostly stable, but continues to be a work in progress while the lectionary is updated to be more future proof.
